                <p className="description">Driven and results oriented. My background of mixed development
                skills has given me a unique proficiency in creating various physical
                and digital solutions. From producing large media installations in a
                studio to running a fireteam in the Estonian military, I know I can rely
                on my skills and work in a team to achieve any result. I have a well
                disciplined work ethic and I am driven by my dream to create
                stunning experiences for individual users or large audiences.</p>
